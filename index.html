                <p>
                    This demonstration allows for the observation of an object falling through a high-viscosity (or "thick") fluid, such as corn syrup or glycerin. It provides a clear visualization of <strong>terminal velocity</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The setup consists of a tall, clear, <strong>sealed</strong> tube filled with the fluid. Small, dense spheres (like marbles or ball bearings) are <strong>sealed inside</strong> the fluid.
                </p>
                <!-- Observable Behavior List -->
                <p>Instead of continuously accelerating, as an object would in a vacuum, the spheres are observed to do the following:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 pl-4">
                    <li>They quickly accelerate for a very short time.</li>
                    <li>They then settle into a <strong>slow, constant speed</strong> (terminal velocity) for the rest of their fall.</li>
                    <li>By using two spheres of the <strong>same material but different sizes</strong>, you can observe that the larger sphere falls with a <strong>faster</strong> terminal velocity than the smaller sphere.</li>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-cyan-400 mb-4">Instructions & Observation:</h3>
                <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-3 text-gray-300 pl-4">
                    <li><strong>Prepare the tube:</strong> Fill the tall container with your viscous fluid. Do not fill it completely; leave a small amount of air at the top to form a single bubble. This bubble is important for flipping the tube.</li>
                    <li><strong>Add the spheres:</strong> Gently drop the large and small spheres into the fluid.</li>
                    <li><strong>Seal the tube:</strong> Securely seal the tube with its cap or stopper. Use epoxy or another waterproof sealant to make it completely leak-proof. Allow the sealant to cure fully.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mark your distances:</strong> For a more quantitative observation, let the tube rest vertically. Once the spheres are at the bottom, use tape or a marker to make two lines on the *outside* of the container:
                        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 pl-6 mt-1">
                            <li>A "Start" line a few centimeters below the end (to allow the spheres to reach terminal velocity).</li>
                            <li>A "Finish" line near the other end (before the spheres get too close to the bottom).</li>
                            <li>Use the ruler to measure the exact distance between these two lines.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Observe the fall:</strong> Hold the tube vertically until the spheres and air bubble are at opposite ends. Quickly <strong>invert (flip) the tube</strong> 180 degrees so the spheres are at the top and the air bubble is at the bottom (the bubble will immediately start to rise).</li>
                    <li><strong>Time the fall:</strong> Watch as the spheres fall through the fluid. Notice how they quickly settle into a constant speed. Use the stopwatch to time how long it takes *each* sphere to travel between the "Start" and "Finish" lines.</li>
                    <li><strong>Compare:</strong> You will have observed that both spheres reached a terminal velocity, and the larger sphere had a much shorter travel time (and thus a higher velocity) over the same distance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Repeat:</strong> To run the observation again, simply wait for the spheres to reach the bottom and then flip the tube over. You can repeat the measurement as many times as you like.</li>
